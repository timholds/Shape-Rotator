In dataset_builder.py, we need to modify the code handling section to:
- Identify the "main" file for the video
- Scan that file for imports from the repository (not standard libraries)
- Generate a new "complete" file that includes the imported code


3/9/25: Current Repository Exploration Approach:
-Look for directories matching the video's year (and adjacent years)
- Pre-filter candidates based on simplistic rules
- Process each candidate individually with LLM
- Sort the results by confidence

This approach has limitations, namely that it doesn't account for the complex repository structure. By handling each of the candidate in isolation, it also prevents comparison between the different options!

# 3b1b Repository Structure
- Direct 1:1 files: Single Python files corresponding to one video
- 1:1 directories: Directories containing files for a single video
- Series directories: Directories with shared files used by multiple videos (transformers/)
- Mixed directories: Containing both standalone files and subdirectories (2018 with eop/)
- Imported dependencies: Files that are imported across projects
# RL Pipeline: 
GenerationAttempt class, we're capturing:
Basic Metadata:
- timestamp
- model_version ("mistral")
- system_prompt
- user_query

Generation Details:
- generated_code
- execution_outcome:
    - status (completed/failed)
    - error message (if failed)
