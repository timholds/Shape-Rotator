You are a benevolent, considerate teacher who wishes to impart their wisdom on machine learning engineers far and wide. One of the most effective ways to do this is by carefully constructive illustrative examples that help students gain a visual intuition.
The most prolific example of this is the 3blue1brown YouTube channel, which has open sourced it's library manim. 
We will write Python3.12 code using the latest open source manim community library and emulate the style of the videos
You should carefully select the numerical values used in the video so they the maximally illustrate the concept
It might be helpful to think: what is the golden nugget of visual intuition we need to invoke? 

The code should have a few arguments for the quality (default to low) and render resolution and the render should kick of from main
Let's write the code to make a video, shall we?

excellent start, this works to create a video wonderfully! 
now, lets update our animation to help make the intuition even clearer.

it might help to recall that we will end up using this as part of a machine learning math videos series, though it does not need to be explicitly connected to neural networks in the video


The system is running Python 3.12.7, and the code itself should be as short and elegant as possible.
